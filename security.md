# Security

## password

-   characters and numbers and punctuation mixed
-   times limited
-   two-factor authentication
-   password managers
-   don't use the same password on multiple sites

## encryption

-   middleman
-   HTTPS
-   end-to-end encryptioned

    > HTTPS is not always end-to-end encrypted. HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, and it is a secure protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet. HTTPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt the data that is being transmitted. However, HTTPS only encrypts the data between the client and the server. The data that is stored on the server is not encrypted.
    >
    > For example, if you are using HTTPS to log into a website, the data that you enter into the login form will be encrypted between your computer and the website's server. However, the data that is stored on the website's server is not encrypted. This means that if the website's server is compromised, the data that you entered into the login form could be accessed by the attacker.
    >
    > In order to have end-to-end encryption, the data would need to be encrypted from the client to the server and from the server to the recipient. This is typically done using a protocol like Signal or WhatsApp.
    >
    > Here are some examples of services that use end-to-end encryption:
    >
    > -   Signal
    > -   WhatsApp
    > -   Telegram
    > -   ProtonMail
    > -   Tutanota
    >
    > These services encrypt the data that is being transmitted between the client and the server, and they also encrypt the data that is stored on their servers. This means that even if the service's servers are compromised, the data that you have sent or received cannot be accessed by the attacker.
    >
    > If you are concerned about the privacy of your data, you should use a service that offers end-to-end encryption. This will help to protect your data from being intercepted by third parties.

-   full-disk encryption
- ransomware

- incognito mode

## Homework
1. Use a password manager
2. Use two-factor authentication
3. Use (end-to-end) encryption
